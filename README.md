## Instructions

#### Step 1: Installing the plugin

Copy the `.jar` file that you received to your Graylog plugin directory which is configured in your `graylog.conf` configuration file using the `plugin_dir` variable. Restart your `graylog-server` process to load the plugin.

Note that you should do this for every `graylog-server` instance you are running.

#### Step 2: Configuring the plugin

The only thing you need to do in your PagerDuty interface is to add a new service called *Graylog*. Click *Services* in the main menu and then hit the *Add new service* button.

Give the new service any name youâ€™d like, for example *graylog* and select an escalation policy. Select *Graylog* from the *Integration type* dropdown box and click *Add Service*.

On the next page you will see the *Service API Key* that Graylog needs to notify PagerDuty about alerts. Copy it.

The last thing to do is to copy that token into the alarm callback configuration in Graylog.

Click *Add alert destination* and you are done. Your PagerDuty account will now receive alerts of this stream.
